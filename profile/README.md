## Welcome to the Native Land Digital Github organization!

Native Land is an app to help map Indigenous territories, treaties, and languages. There is a React Native app (for iOS and Android), as a web application (hosted at https://native-land.ca), and an API that serves the data.

Currently, we are in the process of restructuring our approach to tech work for Native Land. If you would like to contribute to either of the apps, or get involved in helping us build out a streamlined system to help volunteers onboard and contribute, please write to us at info@native-land.ca, or [join our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/native-land/shared_invite/zt-fzzz5o6t-DJgyVU2XR3cY2BPPn1J47g) and introduce yourself and your interests in the #tech channel.
