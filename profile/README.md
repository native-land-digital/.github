## Welcome to the Native Land Digital Github organization!

Native Land is an app to help map Indigenous territories, treaties, and languages. There is a React Native app (for iOS and Android), as a web application (hosted at [https://native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca)), and an API that serves the data.

Our web app has a [public repository here](https://github.com/native-land-digital/next-nld) that you are welcome to take a look at and help out on if you would like to. We would love to have you involved!

You can also [join our Discord here](https://discord.gg/8a6sJfDgD7) to chat with us. This is the best way to get in touch for tech-related issues.

We hope you get to learn something and contribute in the best way you can!
